*We have a list of Person objects  AND one CheckPerson interface with an only method called test 

*We will pass the Data(List of persons) and the method to some another method.

*Passing the method can be done in three ways

*1- implement the CheckPerson Interface providing the definition for test method and send the object of
    implemented class (termed as using local class)
    
*2- we can pass an anonymous implementation of CheckPerson Interface (termed as using anonymous class)


*3- we can use lambda function(termed as using lambdas)
